Following our recent conversation, I have implemented the following changes:

Applied an anomaly detection algorithm to youth accounts (First Saver and Card Plus), utilizing transaction type as a feature.
Incorporated logic to calculate customer age.
Developed a Power BI dashboard that highlights customers marked as anomalies, providing a monthly overview.
If you have any questions or require further clarification regarding the dashboard, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you,
