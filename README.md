As discuss in our last call, I have made the following changes:
-	Applied anomaly detection algorithm on youth account (First Saver and Card Plus) using transaction type as feature.
-	Added logic to calculate customer age.
-	Added power bi dashboard where you can see anomaly marked customer and their monthly view.

Let me know if you have question around dashboard.

Thanks,
